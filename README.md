## 🧪 Code Quality

This project maintains high code quality standards through automated checks:

### Pre-commit Hooks

We use Husky and lint-staged to run checks before each commit:

- TypeScript type checking
- ESLint linting

This ensures that code quality issues are caught before they're committed.

### GitHub Actions

We have GitHub Actions workflows that run on push and pull requests:

- TypeScript type checking
- ESLint linting

These checks must pass before a PR can be merged, ensuring the main branch always maintains high quality standards.

### Running Checks Manually

```bash
# Run TypeScript type checking
npm run type-check

# Run ESLint
npm run lint

# Fix ESLint issues automatically where possible
npm run lint:fix
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Public API key
- `VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Admin API key (secure)

### Supabase Setup

1. Create a Supabase project
2. Enable email authentication
