## Getting Started (First Week Tasks)

To begin implementation immediately, focus on these tasks:

1. ✅ Set up Supabase project and initial database tables
2. ✅ Create the project structure
3. ✅ Configure Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui
4. ✅ Implement the Supabase client
5. ✅ Create basic layout components
