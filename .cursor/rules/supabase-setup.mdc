# Supabase Backend Configuration

## Edge Functions

Edge Functions are located in [supabase/functions/](mdc:supabase/functions) and follow these guidelines:

1. Shared code should be placed in [_shared/](mdc:supabase/functions/_shared)
2. Each function should have its own directory
3. Functions should be typed using TypeScript
4. Implement proper error handling and logging
5. Use environment variables for sensitive data

## Database Migrations

Database migrations are managed in [supabase/migrations/](mdc:supabase/migrations):

1. Each migration should be atomic and reversible
2. Follow the naming pattern: `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_descriptive_name.sql`
3. Include both `up` and `down` migrations
4. Document complex migrations with comments

## Security Guidelines

1. Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies
2. Use proper role-based access control
3. Never expose sensitive data in Edge Functions
4. Validate all user input
5. Use prepared statements for SQL queries

## Environment Configuration

1. Store configuration in `.env` file (not committed to version control)
2. Required environment variables:
   - `SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
3. Use type-safe environment variables

## Development Workflow

1. Test Edge Functions locally using Supabase CLI
2. Run migrations in order
3. Backup database before major changes
4. Use feature branches for development
